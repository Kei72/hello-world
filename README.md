# hello-world
I'm pretty experienced with hardware, networking, and databases. I want to take this opportunity to add some software development skills. 
I will try be focused primarily with machine learning using Java and Python.
I would also like to touch on some VR Application creation.
Thanks in advance for any advice, tutorials, or puzzles that you can give me.
Kei.
